/* Main idea: Starts on purple screen.  User is searching for a door the same color as the screen.
Once they open that door, they get some prize.

Commandments:
1. Make it so that the user cannot possibly find the purple door until ~10 iterations.
2. Adjust the door colors to align with random css colors chose from an array.
3. User must click on one of three doors on the page.
    a. User is then asked a riddle.
        i. If they answer correctly, they move through the door.
        ii. If they answer incorrectly, they are barred from passage through that door. (becomes grey / colorless and inaccessible)
    b. Potential to add more games / puzzles to this as I go.
