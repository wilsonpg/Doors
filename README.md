# Doors

  The Doors Application is a Web Game Application focused on allowing users to traverse a potentially endless pathway in a quest to find the "legendary" Purple Door.  The user will travel through this endless expanse of doors, completing tasks along the way, until they happen across the Purple Door.  The game ends when a user reaches the purple door and enters it, revealing the treasure within.

  I built this game because I thought it was a cool idea to have dynamically generated door colors and tasks.  Also, it was a great way for me to practice setting up a front end webpage with middleware routing connected to a database of my own creation.

  The front end is HTML, CSS, and Javascript sent directly to the browser via my node js - express server. The database is MySQL for no other reason than I've had experience with both MySQL and PostgreSQL and couldn't choose both.
