# Doors

  The Doors Application is a Web Game Application focused on allowing users to traverse a potentially endless pathway in a quest to find the "legendary" Purple Door.  The user will travel through this endless expanse of doors, answering questions along the way, until they happen across The Purple Door.  The game ends when a user reaches the purple door and enters it, revealing a surprise foe guarding the treasure within.

  I built this game because I thought it was a cool idea to have dynamically generated door colors and tasks.  Also, it was a great way for me to practice setting up a front end webpage with middleware routing connected to a database of my own creation.  In the end, it developed into a little more than that as I continued to think of cool ideas to add on.

  The front end is HTML, CSS, and Javascript sent statically to the browser via my Node.js / Express server. The front end JavaScript then interacts with the aforementioned API server using Fetch API requests.  The database is MySQL mostly because I've had experience with both MySQL and PostgreSQL and couldn't choose both.  Also, I've read that MySQL is faster and more efficient when using SELECT queries specifically.  Since I'm not creating, updating, or deleting anything in this application, MySQL seemed to be the best choice.
